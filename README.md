# Tic-Tac-Toe

Winning Strat for Tic-Tac-Toe:

If player 1 (You) starts first:
Three Corner Strat;

- If you start first, go for any corners and from there, you can go for a Triangle-L shape, X shape or Upside down T shape (Plus shape and Askew shape are nearly impossible to win and are kinda risky plays so precede with caution)

If player 2 (Opp) starts first:

- Apply the Three Corner Strat and hope to get a tie

Basic stratgy however there are endless possibilities for each positions on the board
So if player 1 knows which shape can lead to a winning outcome, the player can either play it or if player 2 is going first, then player 1 can block it forcing a tie
