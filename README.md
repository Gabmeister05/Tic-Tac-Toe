# Tic-Tac-Toe

Winning Strat for Tic-Tac-Toe:

If player 1 (You) starts first:
Three Corner Strat;

- If you start first, go for any corners and from there, you can go for a Triangle-L shape or X shape (Plus shape and Askew shape are nearly impossible to get and win)

If player 2 (Opp) starts first:

- Apply the Three Corner Strat and hope to get a tie

Basic stratgy however there are endless possibilities for each positions on the board
